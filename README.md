# README

This is a simple demo of adding location capabilities to an Android app. Because it is focused on the location logic, there are only two otherwise empty activities, `MainActivity` and `LocationActivity`. Click on the `Get Location` button to navigate to the latter. 

## Changelog

12-20: AWS Analytics logic added using the Amplify CLI and Pinpoint plugin. New build not included because running the app causes threading errors I do not know how to solve.
